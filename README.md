The FiM++ module for Python

## About the language
FiM++ (AKA Friendship Reports) is a programming language
devised by Cereal Velocity (the Equestria Daily blogger)
and Kylie Rouge (AKA SupuhStar).

It was inspired by Java, ALGOL, Shakespeare, and Inform 7,
as well as the MLP:FiM 'Friendship Reports'.

Allow me to tell you a story about it:

Once upon a time, the concept of FiM++ started out on this EqD post:

Meanwhile, in DeviantArt, DeftCrow came up with example programs for FiM++:

Two days later, fellow Githubber Karol Stasiak (http://github.com/KarolS/)
decided to upload an interpreter for FiM++ to Github:

And that is part of the story.

## About Project Celestia
Ok, I may not be a brony, but, ever since I found FiM++ interesting,
I have decided to come with a module for Python that interprets FiM++
and compiles FiM++, with an FiM++ IDE attached to it called 'Twilight'.

It all started out on my computer when I used Karol's FiM++ interpreter,
and thought to myself, 'If she can make an FiM++ interpreter, so can I.'

And with sheer amounts of coding, I used Python for making the interpreter.
Sure, it wasn't the only aim, but, other aims included compiling FiM++ to
Python, and making an IDE for FiM++ using Python and TkInter.

After all this coding, I uploaded my work to Github for everybody (and
everypony) to see!

## Development
If you want to author more of my story, just simply fork this repository,
and add your big ideas to Project Celestia!  You can also file issues to help
me improve it as well.

Good luck, have fun, and Excelsior!
